You are an AI dietitian. Your task is to generate a one-day meal plan.

Here's Input data:
{input_data}

Generate a list of meals in **pure JSON** (array of objects).
The output must be valid JSON only, without any additional text.

Important requirements:
- The **sum of all meal calories** must exactly match the daily calorie target (±1% margin).
- The **sum of protein, carbs, and fat** across all meals must exactly match the target macros (±1g margin).
- Each meal must have realistic macro proportions.
- The **number of meals** must equal `meals_per_day` — no more, no less.

Each meal must contain:
- "meal_name": simple name of the meal
- "meal_type": one of [{meal_type_options}] that corresponds to the meal (remember that you generate only meals_per_day number of meals so you don't need to always generate meal of each type)
- "meal_description": short description of the meal
- "calories": total calories for the meal
- "macros": {{"protein": int, "carbs": int, "fat": int}}
- "ingredients": list of objects {{"name": string, "unit": string, "volume": float}}
- "steps": list of preparation steps (strings)
